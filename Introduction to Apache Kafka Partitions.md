- Kafka is a distributed system

- no one topic could ever get too big or aspire to accommodate too many reads and writes
-  Kafka gives us the ability to partition topics.

- Partitioning takes the single topic log and breaks it into multiple logs, each of which can live on a separate node in the Kafka cluster.

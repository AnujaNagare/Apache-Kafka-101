What Does Kafka Connect Do?

- Kafka Connect is an ecosystem of pluggable connectors, and on the other, a client application
-  As a client application, Connect is a server process that runs on hardware independent of the Kafka brokers themselves.
- It is scalable and fault-tolerant, meaning you can run not just one single Connect worker but a cluster of Connect workers that share the load of moving data in and out of Kafka from and to external systems.

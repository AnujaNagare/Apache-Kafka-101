One note: Remember the discussion of partitions up above? Partitions are what take a single topic and break it up into many individual logs that can be hosted on different brokers. Well, it is the producer that makes the decision about which partition to send each message—whether to round-robin keyless messages, compute the destination partition by hashing the key, or apply a custom-configured scheme (although this isn’t very commonly used). In a real sense, partitioning lives in the producer.
